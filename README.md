## Project Overview

In this notebook, we use the LightGBM (LGBM) model to predict student academic achievement. The process includes:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Hyperparameter tuning using grid search.

Model training and evaluation.

The final model achieved a score of 0.83209 on the test data in the Kaggle competition.
